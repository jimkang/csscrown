csscrown lets you apply a CSS class to one selected element and one element only. When you use it to select a different element, it will "unselect" the previous element by removing the css class.

Usage
-----

    var Crown = require('csscrown');
    var crown = Crown({
      crownClass: 'the-ruler-of-all-dom-elements'
    });

    d3.selectAll('.map-node').on('click', function selectNode(d) {
      crown(this); // `this` is a DOM element.
    });

In this example, when an element is clicked, csscrown will add the `the-ruler-of-all-dom-elements` class to the element and remove the `the-ruler-of-all-dom-elements` class from the previously selected element. The `the-ruler-of-all-dom-elements` class can be defined in CSS to distinguish it from the rest of the elements.

    .the-ruler-of-all-dom-elements {
      background-color: yellow;
    }

Installation
------------

    npm install csscrown
